Shortest path in an unweighted graph
Difficulty Level : Medium


Given an unweighted graph, a source, and a destination, we need to find the shortest path from source to destination in the graph in the most optimal way.

unweighted graph of 8 vertices 

Input: source vertex = 0 and destination vertex is = 7.
Output: Shortest path length is:2
        Path is::
        0 3 7

Input: source vertex is = 2 and destination vertex is = 6.
Output: Shortest path length is:5
        Path is::
        2 1 0 3 4 6
